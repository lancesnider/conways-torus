### Why a Torus

I wanted to create a board that looped infinitely. I also wanted a shape where each tile touched exactly 8 other tiles (which ruled out a sphere). A Torus is the only shape that met these criteria. 

### Usage

1. Download [conwaysTorus.unitypackage](https://github.com/lancesnider/conways-torus/raw/master/conwaysTorus.unitypackage).
2. Create a new Unity project. 
3. Go to `Assets` > `Import Package` > `Custom Package` and select the .unitypackage that you just downloaded.
